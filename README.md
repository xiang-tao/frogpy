# frogpy

Shared Python files to achieve some mathematical algorithms and equation solving

This is an algorithm package about python, how to use it?

If you are ubuntu: just run **sudo pip3 install frogpy** in the terminal

If you are windows: open the cmd command and run **pip3 install frogpy**, or if you have anaconda installed, you can run **pip3 install frogpy** on its internal command

If you are using a mac: you can try to run **pip3 install frogpy** on the command line

After everything is ready, create a new Python file in your Python editor and enter the following

```python
import frogpy.algebra.matrix as matrix
a = matrix.tri_diagonal(4, 2, 1, 1)
print(a)
```

No error is reported, and the result of the operation is a matrix. Congratulations on your successful installation
